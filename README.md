# Visualisation-with-TensorBoard
So what is TensorBoard and why would we want to use it? TensorBoard is a suite of web applications for inspecting and understanding your TensorFlow runs and graphs. TensorBoard currently supports five visualizations: scalars, images, audio, histograms, and graphs. The computations you will use in TensorFlow for things such as training a massive deep neural network, can be fairly complex and confusing, TensorBoard will make this a lot easier to understand, debug, and optimize your TensorFlow programs.
